https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec787e00-07cf-4629-b2c2-d1462989a69a


This project is inspired by [TunnelBear's login page](https://www.tunnelbear.com/account/login). It features adorable animations that enhance the user experience while interacting with input fields.

## Features
- **Eye-Catching Animation:** A cute character blinks when the text field is empty and watches the cursor as you type.
- **Playful Privacy Feature:** When typing in a password field, the character covers its eyes for privacy.
- **Smooth User Experience:** The animations are designed to be engaging while maintaining usability.

## TODO
- Find a way to fix the animation flashing issue
- Add uncovering eyes animation when the password field loses focus

## Tech
- Kotlin
- Lottie
- Jetpack Compose

## Known Issues
- LottieAnimation flashes when switching animations.
- Compose doesn’t have a built-in way to get cursors coordinate, so it’s not as accurate as expected.
